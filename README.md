[Live demo](https://ewrecipes.herokuapp.com/).

## Additional comments

My search modal needs some UI improvements. There was a bit of confusion with the mock provided for the search view and this point in the intructions:

- The search results will be displayed where the random recipes were displayed

The modal that I came up with triggers on enter or search click and it closes and shows the results where the random recipes where displayed. Better ux would be to be able to clear the search and go back to the random recipes listing. Also considering saving the random recipes so that they are daily recipes instead of changing everytime the home page is rendered.

I implemented the favorite functionality since it was the most ui appealing. 

This project took me 4hr + 30min of planning. 

## Roadmap

- Improve UI/UX of search modal
- Responsiveness looks good on browser and in the mobile view in the browser but when testing on a real mobile there are some imporovements to be done like the search modal. 
- In mobile only there is only one recipe showing for random meal. 
- Include pagination, specially usefull for search results. 
- Add unit tests
- Add error handling and 404 page.
- Filter recipes by tags would be a nice functionality.
